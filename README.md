# Skyward Scammer

Skyward Scammer is a unique top-down RPG game where the protagonist, leveraging wit and charm, scams a dealer and embarks on an adventurous journey soaring above the world with balloons.

This project was a result of a lot of awesome online learning resources, especially `@javidx9` on Youtube. I hope its fun for you to play with :)
